_4. Why did I create this app?_

```
- I follow these basic steps during EDA on Notebooks and BI tools. Hence, I decided to implement them directly 
  before taking further visualization steps.
- The idea was inspired from pandas-profiling tool --> https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/master/index.html.
